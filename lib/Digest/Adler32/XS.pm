=head1 NAME

Digest::Adler32::XS - Generate Adler32 digests efficiently

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Digest::Adler32::XS;
    my $digest = Digest::Adler32::XS->new();

    # add stuff
    $digest->add($some_data);
    $digest->addfile(*STDIN);

    # get digest
    print "Adler32: ", $digest->hexdigest, "\n";
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a more efficient version of L<Digest::Adler32|Digest::Adler32>, 
and conforms to the same API. The digest calculations are performed 
internally in C for performance. Benchmarks show that this module typically
performance 300 times faster than Digest::Adler32. 

=head1 SEE ALSO

RFC 1950, which defines the Adler-32 checksum algorithm:
http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1950.html

Another implementation of Adler-32 is provided in the
L<Digest::Adler32|Digest::Adler32> module.
